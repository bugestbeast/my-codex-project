# StayFinder Demo

This project showcases a small property listing page inspired by Airbnb's layout. It includes a navigation menu, a prominent search bar on the homepage, and a responsive grid of sample properties.

## Running the Server

A tiny Python server is included for local testing. Run the following from the project directory:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to see the page.
