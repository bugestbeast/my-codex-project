# Simple Color Changer Webpage

This repository contains a minimal webpage that allows you to change the background color each time you click a button. A small Python server script (`main.py`) is included to host the page.

## Running the server

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. From the project directory, run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

Click the **Change Color** button to cycle through a few colors.
